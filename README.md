# CNN-Image-Classification

Description

This project implements a 5-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using PyTorch. The goal is to demonstrate the complete deep learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation.

Dataset

Source: Kaggle image dataset

Images resized to 224×224

Dataset split into training and testing sets

Tech Stack

Python

PyTorch & Torchvision

Google Colab

NumPy

Matplotlib

PIL

Model

5 convolutional layers with ReLU and MaxPooling

Fully connected layers with Dropout

Loss: CrossEntropyLoss

Optimizer: Adam

Results

Test Accuracy: ~19%

Model trained from scratch on a small dataset

Accuracy reflects baseline performance due to limited data and training time

Future Improvements

Use pretrained models (ResNet, VGG)

Increase dataset size

Apply data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning
